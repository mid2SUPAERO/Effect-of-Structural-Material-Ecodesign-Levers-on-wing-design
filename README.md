## ✈️ Eco-Design of Aircraft Wings Using Advanced Materials and Optimization

This repository supports the research project titled **“Effect of Structural/Material Ecodesign Levers on Wing Design”**, conducted as part of academic work at ISAE-SUPAERO. The project investigates the potential of advanced materials and optimization algorithms to reduce the environmental impact and structural weight of commercial aircraft wings.

### 🧪 Project Overview

The main research goals are:

* **Aero-structural optimization** of Airbus A320/A321 wings using various materials.
* **Evaluation of material impact** on weight, fuel burn, and emissions.
* **Multi-objective optimization** for new material composition using generative models.

The study leverages tools like **OpenAeroStruct** and builds upon the **CatalogsVAE** framework.
