# CatalogsVAE - Extended for Multi-Objective Material Composition Optimization

This repository builds upon the original [CatalogsVAE](https://github.com/UW-ERSL/CatalogsVAE) project by extending its scope to include **multi-objective optimization of new material compositions**. 

Our goal is to explore the continuous space of synthesized materials using **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)**, and optimize for properties such as **cost, energy consumption, material waste**, and **effective density** ‚Äî under realistic material blending constraints.

## üìÑ Project Highlights

- **Trained VAE on real engineering material data**
- **Synthetic dataset** of 5000 valid material blends generated using domain constraints
- **Feature extraction**: `cost`, `energy`, `waste`, `rho_eff`
- **Latent space embedding** of new materials for intuitive visualization and optimization
- **Optimization-ready latent space** for future multi-objective search (e.g., NSGA-II)

## üìÅ Structure
